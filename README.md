# advanced-chat
This is my first advanced chat I have created for my web development course.

Project goal from SBCD instructors: A picture is worth a thousand words. The goal for this project is to add the ability to send an animated gif within our chat application. Weâ€™ll base this project on our existing simple chat project and use the GIPHY api.
